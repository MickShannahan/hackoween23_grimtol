        In a distant realm a there was a kingdom where happiness and prosperity reigned. The kingdom thrived under the rule of a wise and benevolent king. Bustling trade and merchant stalls filled the streets, and the fields were full each harvest.
      </p>
      <p>
        But a dark cloud fell upon the land. The beloved king, who had ruled with kindness for many years, fell ill. Desperate to find a cure, he offered a generous reward to anyone who could heal him, with the sole desire of continuing his benevolent rule. Many healers and sorcerers tried but non could aid him.
      </p>
<p>
  Then, one fateful day, a mysterious stranger entered the royal court, claiming to not only possess the cure the king seeked but more. However the stranger's proposition was unlike any other. He promised to not only restore the king's health but to bestow upon him and the entire kingdom the gift of eternal life. All that was required was the construction of a tower that reached as high as the tallest mountain in the land. The king, seduced by the stranger's words, agreed without realizing the curse that accompanied the magic.
</p>
  <p>
    As years passed, the tower extended towards the heavens. Slowly but surely, the curse unleashed by the stranger used the tower to siphon the very souls of the kingdom, transforming its inhabitants into grotesque and malevolent versions of their former selves.
  </p>
  <p>
Stories of the curse's grip spread to neighboring kingdoms, sparking fear and concern. In response, the great druids of the realm were summoned to contain this monstrous affliction. In a solemn ceremony, they sealed city and it's tower beneath the earth, covering and covering it with a dense forest. With the once-thriving kingdom buried beneath the earth, its grandeur and tragedy faded into forgotten history...
