    <p>
      In a distant realm a there was a kingdom. It contained a great city that thrived through advancements in science and
      magic for it's people. Its schools and colleges we know across the land. All this research and knowledge lead to
      bustling trade, full fields each harvest and of course happy people... But not everyone shared this vision of
      growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a dark cloud fell upon the land. The beloved king, who had ruled with kindness for many years, fell ill.
      Confident in his peoples abilities, he offered a generous reward to anyone who could heal him, with the sole desire
      of continuing the growth of the kingdom. Many healers and sorcerers tried but non could aid him, the sickness was
      quite unnatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, one fateful day, a mysterious stranger entered the royal court, claiming to not only possess the cure the king
      seeked but more. However the stranger's proposition was unlike any other. He promised to not only restore the king's
      health but to bestow upon him and the entire kingdom the gift of eternal life. All that was required was the
      construction of a tower that reached as high as the tallest mountain in the land. The king, seduced by the
      stranger's words, agreed without realizing the curse that accompanied the magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      As years passed, the tower extended towards the clouds. As the tower grew so did the power of the strangers curse,
      transforming its inhabitants into grotesque and disfigured versions of their former selves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stories of the curse's grip spread to neighboring kingdoms, sparking fear. In response, several great druids were
      summoned to contain this monstrous affliction. In a solemn ceremony, they sealed city, it's inhabitants and the
      monolithic tower beneath the ground, covering it with a dense forest. With the once-thriving kingdom buried beneath
      the earth, its grandeur and tragedy faded into forgotten history...
